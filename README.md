## About the Project
Front-end: React, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS (JSX)
Back-end: Node.js/Express

The website contains two components: the front-end, and a back-end server which wraps around the OpenAI API (this was created with the intent to hide our API key). 

Additional Features: 
- [X] Ability to select the OpenAI engine used for the completion API
- [X] Back-end API Proxy Server (mainly to hide the API key)
- [X] Responsive Design (for mobile), using Bootstrap
- [X] [Figma Mockup of the Site](https://www.figma.com/file/zoVql77EwmMoKdf9Y6SxCj/Shopify-Challenge%2C-OpenAI-(Fall-2022)?node-id=0%3A1)
